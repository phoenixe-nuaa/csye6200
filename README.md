### Checklist:

Make sure that your program is a runnable .jar file with a manifest
Have someone double check your work to see if the file actually runs.
Check the filenames
Ensure that you have both running code and a source code submission
Additional Questions: 

1. Have you checked your code quality?
- Are the classes and variables named well? 
- Do you have appropriate comments?
- Does your program inherit from the supplied abstract class?
2. Do you have a working growth simulation?
- Does is run too fast or too slow?
- Does the program scale and manage memory well?
3. Have you implemented multiple rules?  
- Are your rules unique?
- Use of inheritance will likely yield a higher score.
4. Does your program implement start/stop functionality?
- Can you restart?
- Can you pause?
- Can you start multiple times without error?
5. Do you have good threading?
- Do you demonstrate use of good thread control?
- What happens to existing threads on a restart?
- What happens to a thread if you stop?
6. Does your UI exhibit proper operation?
- Does resizing during a simulation run work properly?
- Does the UI work properly while a simulation is running?
7. Is the UI pleasing to look at?
- Are controls well laid out and understandable?
- Are buttons and controls enabled/disabled when appropriate?
- Is the style consistent and attractive?
8. Does the simulation produce good visual quality?
- Is the display designed well?
- Have you used size, color, texture and other elements to improve the display?
