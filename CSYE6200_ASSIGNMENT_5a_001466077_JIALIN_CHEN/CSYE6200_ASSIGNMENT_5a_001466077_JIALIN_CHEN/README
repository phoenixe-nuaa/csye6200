** File Description:**
In project CSYE6200Assign5a's package *edu.neu.csye6200.bg*:
- BGStem.java : BGStem class defines a stem with initial position and length and child stems which are stems that originate at its tip
- BGRule.java : BGRule class converts a stem into a stem with child stems,control the relative angles of each child stem and govern the growth in terms of length and width. BGRule class can extend a new generation of stems based on a prior stem graph.
- BGGeneration.java : BGGeneration class holds a full tree based on BGRule
- BGGenerationSet.java : BGGenerationSet class holds multipe BGGenerations with corresponding called BGRule class.
In project CSYE6200Assign5a's *src* there are two output files:
- BGGeneration.txt : Test of BGGeneration class' output
- BGGenerationSet.txt : Test of BGGenerationSet class' output

** Instruction:**
`Please check all the codes and comments.`
Run the main method in `BGGeneration class` and `BGGenerationSet class` to check the test result.
Thank you.
