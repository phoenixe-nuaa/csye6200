**File Description:**

- src: the Source file of this program, including Stem, BGRule, BGGenerationSet, BGFrame, BGPanel and RuleSet files.
- Assignment5a_output_Yixuan Wang: the text file of a copy of this program's output, showing the contents of generation set and images of
                                   trees' growing abiding by 3 different rules.

**Introduction:**

You can open the BGFrame class file and then run my program.
You can click the button in the menu of 'RULE' for choosing the rule to make tree grow in different ways.
Different growing rules of trees actually means that their stems all have diffferent growing radians and different lengths.
If you click the button named 'CLEAR', then you will make the panel clear.
Please check the 'Assignment5a_output_Yixuan Wang.pdf' file at first.

[PS: There are two ArrayList in my Program: StemList and childStem List. 
StemList is used for storing all stem instances(including base stem) and constructing the generationSetMap.
ChildStemList is used for storing all children stems(excluding Base Stem). 
If you want to see the contents of ChildStemList, you can call the method named 'printChildStems()' in the paint method 
in BGRule Class.(when you are checking my program, you can see that I have already done it before.)]

Thank you very much for checking my Assignment 5a.
